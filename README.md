# Watermark

A privacy-first web app for watermarking sensitive images (passports, IDs, documents).

**All processing happens locally in your browser. Your files never leave your device.**

## Features

- Drag and drop one or more images, or click to upload
- Diagonal repeated watermark grid with live preview
- Configurable text, color, opacity, font, rotation, spacing, and anti-removal noise
- Download as PNG, JPG, or PDF — multiple images are bundled into a ZIP
- Zero server calls, no tracking, no analytics

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build   # output goes to dist/
```

The output is a fully self-contained static site. Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.
